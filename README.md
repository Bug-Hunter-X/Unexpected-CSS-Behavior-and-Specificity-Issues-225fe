This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to unexpected behavior in :hover and :focus pseudo-classes, specificity issues, and unintended selector targeting. The bug.css file contains the erroneous CSS code, and bugSolution.css provides the corrected version. The problem involves overriding styles due to specificity conflicts and selectors affecting elements unintentionally. The solution focuses on improving selector specificity and cascade control for better styling precision.
