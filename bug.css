The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when targeting elements with specific pseudo-classes like :hover or :focus. This could be due to specificity issues, where other styles with higher specificity are overriding the intended styles. Another possible cause could be the order of the CSS rules in the stylesheet.  Sometimes, CSS selectors may inadvertently target more elements than intended, resulting in unexpected visual consequences. For example, a selector that is too broad might style elements it shouldn't affect, or styles might cascade in an unexpected way due to inheritance and the cascade.
